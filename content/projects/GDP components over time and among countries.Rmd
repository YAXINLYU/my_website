# GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

Tidy data:

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data  <-  gather(UN_GDP_data, Year, GDP_components, "1970":"2017", factor_key=TRUE)%>%
                  mutate(GDP_components = GDP_components / (10^9)) %>%
                  mutate(IndicatorName = if_else(IndicatorName == 'Exports of goods and services', 'Exports', IndicatorName))%>%
                  mutate(IndicatorName = if_else(IndicatorName == 'Imports of goods and services', 'Imports', IndicatorName))%>%
                  mutate(IndicatorName = if_else(IndicatorName == 'General government final consumption expenditure', 'Government expenditure', IndicatorName))%>%
                  mutate(IndicatorName = if_else(IndicatorName == 'Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)', 'Household expenditure', IndicatorName))

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

In terms of household expenditure percentage, Germany stays flat at 60% in the given time frame, a bit decreasing after 2000 to nearly 50%; US gradually increases to 70%, while India's percentage has dropped sharply by 20% between 1980 and 2010 and stayed flat ever since around 55%.

In terms of gross capital formation percentage, Germany decreases from 30% in 1970 to 20% recently. US increases a bit from below 20% to 20%+, while India jumps from 25% in 2000 to 40% in 2010 as a peak, then back to 35% most recently.

In terms of government expenditure percentage, both Germany and India have almost stayed flat in the observation period, at 20% and 10% respectively. However, US has gradually decreased from 25% in 1970 to 15% most recently.

In terms of net exports percentage, both US and India have stayed below 0% in most times while Germany has witnessed an increase since 2000 from zero line to 7% most recently.
