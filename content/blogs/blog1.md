My name is LYU YAXIN. I am a student from the London Business School and about to obtain the master’s degree in financial analysis this June. The study of this course let me have a great interest in financial markets.
I have got excellent analytical and communication skills from past internships focusing on corporate finance and market research. With strong attention to detail and good dedication to my work, I had successfully added extra value to previous employers. I’m both a good team player and a self-starter, and my genuine interest in financial markets makes me proactive and productive at work.
Being a student come from China, I believe the interaction between me and my colleagues would be a process of cultural blending and collision of thoughts.
I am not only a good motivator in teamwork but also have very good project management skills. So, I believe I can corporate with the team to complete the projects efficiently. Also, I am a critical thinker who likes to challenge the assumptions which underpin many mainstream models of economics and finance, and naturally curious, I observe and try to understand world around me. Lastly, I am an analytical thinker who enjoys work through logically and analyse information to fully understand situations. Thus, I am very willing to put forward compromising approach and make contributions to the summer internship.
